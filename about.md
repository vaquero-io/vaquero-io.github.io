Vaquero is an extensible vm provisioning and bootstrap automation tool for
managing the multiple servers, roles, and environments that make up a typical
continuous delivery architectural design for a web based
software-as-a-service application.

Vaquero is in early stages of active, heavy development, and our goal is to
be able to target any cloud provider. Current work is focussing on provisioning
through vCenter Orchestrator, driving custom vCO Workflows and a vCAC/vRA
Blueprint. Planned work also includes provisioning against vSphere (without
vCAC/vRA), as well as cloud providers (likely via the Fog library).
