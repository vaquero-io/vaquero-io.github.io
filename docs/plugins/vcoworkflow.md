The `vaquero-plugin-workflow` plugin leverages a set of workflows in VMware vRealize Orchestrator plus a special template blueprint and corresponding service catalog entry in order to programattically provision your platform via VMware's vCloud IaaS offering.

At this time, this plugin requires a very specific set of workflows to exist, and the entrypoint workflow, `Request Component` is currently under active development and should hopefully see a release on [FlowGrab](https://flowgrab.com) some time soon.
