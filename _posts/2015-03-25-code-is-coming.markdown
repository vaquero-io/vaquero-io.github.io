This all started life as an internal project at
[ACTIVE Networks, LLC](http://activenetwork.com), because we wanted a way to
automate the provisioning of the virtual infrastructure that drives our
product platforms. It's already been open-sourced and is hosted on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/activenetwork-automation/putenv), but we've decided
that this project needs its own identity, so we're moving it here, to Vaquero.io.

The main code for the `vaquero` utility itself will be published in its renamed
form in the next day or so [here](https://github.com/vaquero-io/vaquero), and
the various plugins will follow in the next few days as we refactor it all
for the new project name.

So, stay tuned, lots of work in progess!
