Hello! Welcome to Vaquero.io!

Vaquero is a tool that lets you rapidly, repeatably and reliably generate your
application's virtual infrastructure from a simple set of definition files. It
is currently in very early, very heavy development, and still has a way to go
before its first official release.

Our goal with Vaquero is to have a single tool to provision and bootstrap all
the VMs needed for a web application platform, as well as maintain that
platform over its lifecycle. Starting with the platform definition file, you
lay out all the components you need to support your application: web servers,
cache servers, app servers, etc. You can then generate any number of
environments (for example: integration, QA, staging and production) and even
override any configurations in a per-component or per-environment basis.

More details will definitely be coming soon, as well as configuration examples
and code.

Start treating your cloud-based application servers less like pets, and more
like the cattle they are. Simplify the creation and management of your herd,
and let Vaquero drive your cloud cattle!
